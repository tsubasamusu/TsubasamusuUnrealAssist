The settings related to this feature are as follows.

| Property Name | Description |
----|----
| Open AI API Key | API key created in [API keys - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). |
| GPT Language | The language of comments generated by GPT. |
| GPT Model Name | GPT model name. The default value is "gpt-4o-mini". The names of available GPT models can be found in [Models - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models). |
| Ignore Nodes Do Not Have Connected Pins | Whether to ignore nodes that have no input pins, output pins, execution pins, etc. |
| Ignore Comment Nodes | Whether to ignore comment nodes contained within a comment node. |
| Comment Generation Conditions | Conditions that GPT must adhere to when generating comments. Example: “answer briefly” |

### Make Array
When multiple nodes with output pins of the same type are selected and right-clicked, the “Make Array” menu appears, and selecting the menu creates a Make Array node with all of those output pins connected.

### Translate Comments
When you right-click on a comment node, a menu labeled 'Translate to...' appears, allowing you to select the target language and translate the comment. This translation feature uses the DeepL API, and the API key can be configured in the editor settings under "Comment Translation > DeepL API Key".

### Copy Nodes in JSON Format
It copies the information of selected nodes as a JSON-formatted string. This JSON-formatted string includes the node and pin names, node comments, pin direction (input or output), pin type, and the GUID of the connected pins. The copied data is currently saved to the clipboard and its character count is approximately one-third of that of the text that can be obtained using the standard Unreal Engine copy function.
